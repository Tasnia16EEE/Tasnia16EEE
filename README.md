## Hi there, I'm Tasnia Sultana 👋

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer based in the USA, passionate about building scalable and responsible AI solutions for edge devices. I love learning new things and am always looking for new challenges.

😎 Pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science & Systems, conducting research on small multimodal large language model deployment for the medical domain, with a focus on edge devices.

✔️ Completed a Bachelor’s in Electrical & Electronic Engineering, with hands-on experience in semiconductor device fabrication, computer architecture, and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).

🔭 I’m currently working on on-device ML, responsible and trustworthy AI.

🌱 I’m currently learning multimodal model training, evaluation, and edge deployment.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and hardware optimization projects.

💬 Ask me about deploying models on resource-constrained devices.
